Logistic Regression -  LDA


### Summary
Execution and test of various Machine Learning techniques including Logistic Regression and LDA

### In Detail
In the beggining of the excercise we import various libraries that are important for handling data and performing various Machine Learning Techniques.

The intuition behind the excercise is to generate data and split it into two main categories, the trainning and the testing dataset. We then further split out data into IS (In Sample) and OS (Out of Sample).
Furthermore, take the IS dataset and perform the K-Fold cross validation for the two selected techniques.

Through the Cross Validation stage we extract the best performing model and we then use it to test it on the OOS data.
